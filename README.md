This is the api used in Forkify app to get the data and render it.

### Overview📃
The basic structure and styling is made using **HTML** and **SCSS**. Vanila Javascript is used for the functionality of the app.
Here in this application I have used the **MVC** architecture.<br>

MVC stands for-
+ **Model**
+ **View**
+ **Controller**

<br>This helps isolating the visual part of the application from the business part or in simple terms it abstracts the styling from functionality. Controller is used make the connection between these two.

### What can you do with Forkify?🤔
To answer this question we have to consider the fact that it a simple application made for practising javascript concepts and use them in real life so it is far from a full fledged real world apllication with lots of advanced features.<br> 
But still it has some cool features. I will just list down the features below-
+ **🔍 You can search for a wide variety of recipe**
